        <h2>Voidagon Under Attack: The Misinformation About Unblocking Fortnite and Roblox</h2>

        <p>Recently, a new individual (His name starts with H, and ends with M.)  has started circulating claims that they can unblock Fortnite and Roblox, promising easy access to these games. While it's clear to many that these claims are simply fake, unfortunately, a number of people are falling into the trap, leaving Voidagon in the process. It's crucial to address this misinformation and protect our community from further damage.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, it’s important to clarify that unblocking Roblox is not as simple as this individual is suggesting. Roblox is blocked for a reason—whether for security, privacy, or network management—and claiming to bypass these restrictions is misleading. More importantly, unblocking Fortnite takes significantly more time, involving proxies, VPNs, and various network configurations. The idea that it can be done effortlessly is nothing short of a scam.</p>

        <p>Moreover, this individual may even be asking for money in exchange for these unblocking services. This is a dangerous red flag. They are exploiting the desire for quick solutions to manipulate people into paying for a service that is either ineffective or impossible to deliver. This type of behavior is unacceptable, and we must make sure to warn others before they fall victim to these deceptive practices.</p>

        <p>Additionally, using Roblox on a managed Chromebook is highly unlikely without a browser-based emulator, and such emulators are not easily accessible or supported on these devices. Without special handling—such as rooting the device or bypassing security protocols—attempting to run these games could lead to a range of issues, from breaking the device to exposing personal data.</p>

        <p>It is essential that the Voidagon community remain cautious about individuals making extravagant promises. Let's not let these scammers infiltrate our ranks. If someone claims to have a magic fix for unblocking these games, it’s likely they’re just after money and exploiting the frustrations of students and gamers alike.</p>
